# ML-DL
This repository contains all my Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects.

It covers key concepts such as:
  
  1. Decision Tree
  2. Linear Regression
  3. Traditional Neural Networks
  4. Small Language Models (SLMs)

These projects have helped me develop strong coding practices and gain in-depth knowledge of each topic.
