Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects. This collection showcases my journey through key ML/DL concepts, ranging from foundational algorithms to modern neural architectures, including a basic exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs) and GPT-like structures.

Topics Covered:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Traditional Neural Networks

Small Language Models (SLMs) â€” inspired by Andrej Karpathy's work
